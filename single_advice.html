                    <p>Do you have a fence that shares a boundary line with a neighbor? If so, then you may know that it can be difficult to get your fence replaced. No one wants to be stuck with the backside of a fence facing their yard, especially if they’re paying for a portion.</p>
                    <p>But that’s where the good neighbor fence comes in. This is a fence that will help homeowners on both sides of the fence be satisfied with what they see from their yard.</p>
                    <p>There’s no need to have an eyesore on one side of the fence. But there are a few things you need to know about good neighbor fences.</p>
                    <p>We’ll cover what a good neighbor fence is, the laws surrounding them, and how you can get one.</p>
                    <h3>What exactly is a good neighbor fence?</h3>
                    <p>A good neighbor fence looks the same on both sides. This solves the issue of one side of the fence looking presentable while the other side, facing your yard, is just the posts and stringers. This is especially important when it comes to a shared fence on a boundary line with a neighbor. No one needs to compromise and accept that they have the “bad side” if you use this kind of fence.</p>
                    <h3>What’s the law for a good neighbor fence?</h3>
                    <p>While there technically aren’t state laws regulating the aesthetics of a fence, you do need to keep in mind local ordinances and covenants, conditions , CC&R’s may regulate that.</p>
                    <p>You also need to know the laws surrounding installing a new fence on a boundary line as well. </p>
                    <p>In the state of California: “Adjoining landowners are presumed to share an equal benefit from any fence dividing their properties and, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in a written agreement, shall be presumed to be equally responsible for the reasonable costs of construction, maintenance, or necessary replacement of the fence.”</p>
                    <p>If you’d like, you can read more about the law here:</p>
                    <p class="highlight">http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=841</p>
                    <p class="italic">This means you’ll typically be sharing the cost of a new fence with your neighbor. That of course presents some more steps for you to take if you want to install a new fence on a boundary line with your neighbor.</p>
                    <h3>What do I need to do if I want a fence on a boundary line?</h3>
                    <p>You must make sure you send your neighbor a notice of your intention to build a new fence, at least 30 days before you start. Of course, they also must agree with your intentions to build a new fence as well.</p>
                    <p>Your notice must include a description of the problem with the fence, your planned solution, estimated costs, how to split those costs, and a timeline for getting the fence installed.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it’s also important to talk things through with your neighbor and show them how a new fence would benefit both of you. </p>
                    <p>Now that you know what a good neighbor fence is, the laws surrounding them, and what you need to do to get one, you’ll be all set with starting the process of getting a new fence that both you and your neighbor can enjoy.</p>
